# ASU Data Analysis Spring 2024

## Description
All course activity files and slides will be pushed to this repository.

## Installation
### Python dev environment
First install Anaconda by following the instructions at this bootcampspot [link](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5315/pages/3-getting-started?module_item_id=1238161), but stop after you complete step 3, "Updating the conda base environment."

Instead of running step 4 to create the `dev` environment, run these commands in git bash (for Windows) or the terminal (for Mac).  Make sure you navigate to the root folder where you have cloned this gitlab repository.

```
conda deactivate
conda create -n my_env python=3.10
conda activate my_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
